# Description:  	This program will prompt the user for a year after 1582
#                   and determine if itâ€™s a leap year. It will also calculate
#                   how long ago, or how far in the future, the given year is.
# Input:        	Year (int)
# Output:       	Welcome message (string), input prompt (string), error
#                   message (string), result message (string), goodbye message
#                   (string), distance from year (int)
